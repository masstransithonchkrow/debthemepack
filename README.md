<h1>DebThemePacks for Ubuntu</h1>
  <br />
  <h2>What is the purpose of this?</h2>
<p>
I'm trying to recreate the convenience of DeskThemePacks (currently available to Windows 8 users and later) for Debian and any installation loosely based on it. Linux overall is a more intensive customization environment and it requires relearning a number of things. My Database instructor emphasized that we should know how SQL works, even if Access does it for us, as the time would come when we needed to do what Access does but without Access (which MS has been trying to kill for ages).
</p>
</p>
<h2>What should I expect?</h2>
<p>This repository is the sum of most of my efforts. It relies on shell scripts, consistent folder placement and the porting out of resources using Windows-centric apps to make it happen. This is an effort to make Ubuntu easier to transition to. Because customization is more unnbound in Linux, I feel this is a better challenge for me than simply 'Theming Like It's 1999'.</p> <br />
<h2>Do you have examples of existing work?</h2>
<p id="outset">Yes, I do. Discover more of my efforts on Windows <a href="https://365stops.org/deskthemepack" title="DeskThemePack Gallery | 365stops.ORG" target="_blank">here</a>. Some will still link to my DeviantArt page or the pages of others who have helped me port these themes. I will include screengrabs from my Ubuntu installation as a way to show visual progress.</p><br />
<h2>What should the finished product look like?</h2>
<p>The finished product should be structured in a way that when it is extracted, it will merge with any similarly named folders on your system. Such decompression will reqire elevation as system files are appended. Unlike Windows, where Themes are stored in a user folder, themes in Linux are stored in folders outside 'Home'. If you believe there is a better way, I'm all ears. I want to avoid elevation whenever possible.</p><br />

<h2>If I want to provide feedback, where do I send it?</h2>
<p>You can send me a <a href="mailto:masstransitkrow@pm.me?subject=[Feedback]" title="" target="_blank">private message</a>.</p> <br />
<h2>Can I Help?</h2>
<p>I don't see why not. Having someone who understands shell scripting better than me would be appreciated. Also, once I get this working for Ubuntu, you could help me make it work with other distros, like XFCE, KDE, FEDORA, and SUSE.</p>
