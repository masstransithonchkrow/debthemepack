<h1>DebThemePacks for Debian Distros</h1>
  <br />
  <h2>What is the purpose of this?</h2>
<p>
I'm trying to recreate the convenience of DeskThemePacks (currently available to Windows 8 users and later) for Debian and any installation loosely based on it. Linux overall is a more intensive customization environment and it requires relearning a number of things. I am happy to announce that the latest iterations of my scripts DO NOT require elevation and can use existing resources.
</p>
<h2>What should I expect?</h2>
<p>This repository is the sum of most of my efforts. It relies on shell scripts, consistent folder placement and the porting out of resources using Windows-centric apps to make it happen. This is an effort to make Unix easier to transition to. Because customization is more unbound in Linux, I feel this is a better challenge for me than simply 'Theming Like It's 1999'.</p> <br />
<h2>Do you have examples of existing work?</h2>
<p id="outset">Yes, I do. I have overhauled my DeskThemePack page and have entered debthemepacks under a new campaign. Aero themes are cross-referred to their Debian counterparts. Please visit <a href="https://365stops.org/debthemepack" title="DebThemePack Gallery on 365stops.ORG" target="_blank">here</a> to see what I have..</p><br />
<h2>What should the finished product look like?</h2>
<p>A true finished product isn't the intention. Some assembly is required. Linux is a lot more customizable, and the potential for fantastic or disastrous results is much higher depending on the circumstances and your affinity to the OS. These scripts could include dconf directives, but I think it would scare new users, so I am encouraging them to insert the directives themselves. Sounds and icons must be manually applied and have no known dconf directive. I don't know where the settings for sounds and icons are stored. Once I do, I will update this guidance.</p><br />

<p>This is made available using the Affero General Public License Version 3. I do not wish for this to be monetized as I am trying to foster adoption, and that is difficult if you put up a paywall.</p><br />
<h2>If I want to provide feedback, where do I send it?</h2>
<p>You can send me a <a href="mailto:masstransitkrow@pm.me?subject=[Feedback]" title="" target="_blank">private message</a>.</p> <br />
<h2>Can I Help?</h2>
<p>I don't see why not. Having someone who understands shell scripting better than me would be appreciated. This currently works on Debian, Mint and Ubuntu, but you could help me make it work with other distros/desktops, like XFCE, KDE, FEDORA, and SUSE. I'm migrating away from Ubuntu but since Mint and Ubuntu are both Debian-based, the command terminology should be similar enough that making headway with one OS is good for the other. At present, I can confirm that these themes work on LMDE4 and Linux Mint Ulyana.</p>
