<h1>DebThemePacks for Unix</h1>
  <br />
  <h2>What is the purpose of this?</h2>
<p>
I'm trying to recreate the convenience of DeskThemePacks (currently available to Windows 8 users and later) for Debian and any installation loosely based on it. Linux overall is a more intensive customization environment and it requires relearning a number of things. I am happy to announce that the latest iterations of my scripts DO NOT require elevation and can use existing resources.
</p>
<h2>What should I expect?</h2>
<p>This repository is the sum of most of my efforts. It relies on shell scripts, consistent folder placement and the porting out of resources using Windows-centric apps to make it happen. This is an effort to make Unix easier to transition to. Because customization is more unbound in Linux, I feel this is a better challenge for me than simply 'Theming Like It's 1999'.</p> <br />
<h2>Do you have examples of existing work?</h2>
<p id="outset">Yes, I do. I am currently overhauling my DeskThemePack page and will enter debthemepacks under a new campaign. Once assembled, I will cross reference them accordingly. DebTheemPacks will have their own page.</p><br />
<h2>What should the finished product look like?</h2>
<p>A true finished product isn't the intention. Unlike other X11 resources on this site, this is designed to rely on bash, which comes with Linux. I see NO NEED to use Python to achieve the expected effect, which is to convert Windows cursors by extracting their PNG frames, into X11 compatible cursors, which use those frames. I am doing all the hit and miss by testing these out in the field so you don't have to.</p><br />

<p>This is made available using the Affero General Public License Version 3. I do not wish for this to be monetized as I am trying to foster adoption, and that is difficult if you put up a paywall.</p><br />
<h2>If I want to provide feedback, where do I send it?</h2>
<p>You can send me a <a href="mailto:masstransitkrow@pm.me?subject=[Feedback]" title="" target="_blank">private message</a>.</p> <br />
<h2>Can I Help?</h2>
<p>I don't see why not. Having someone who understands shell scripting better than me would be appreciated. Also, once I get this working for Ubuntu, you could help me make it work with other distros, like XFCE, KDE, FEDORA, and SUSE. I'm migrating away from Ubuntu but since Mint and Ubuntu are both Debian-based, the command terminology should be similar enough that making headway with one OS is good for the other.</p>
