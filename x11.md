<h1>X11 cursor conversion</h1>

<h2>What is the purpose of this file?</h2>
<p>This file lists the steps needed to convert Windows animated cursors into X11 format, which is used by Linux.</p><br />

<h2>What will I need?</h2>
<p>You will need a program that can edit cursor and animated cursors, like AniFX Portable.<br />
Animated cursors can be opened if you type their names directly. When they do, you must
extract all visible frames as PNG files. Maintain a consistent naming convention for all files.
You will need a text editor to map out the cursors. Please use the following conventions:</p><br />

```
pixel size x-position y-position png-filename
```

<br /><p>If you're working with animated cursors, the following convention is needed:</p>

```
pixel-size x-position y-position png-filename-framenumber milliseconds
pixel-size x-position y-position png-filename-framenumber milliseconds
```

<p>For each png, there should be an extra line. <br />
Save the file as `cursorname.cursor`. You'll need to repeat this for every cursor. If I can find a way to automate the process, you'll hear from me first.</p>

<h2>I've created the renders and the .cursor files, now what?</h2>
<p>From your Linux Terminal, issue the following commands for each .cursor file to create an X11 cursor:</p>

```
xcursorgen [.cursor file] [name_of_x11_cursor]
```

<p>This will create an X11 cursor in the same directory. If you run into errors, make sure your <br />
.cursor files follow the conventions listed above. The X-Position and Y-Position are known as the cursor 'hotspot'.<br />
I recommend an animation transition between 60[msec] to at least 150[msec], with higher [msec] meaning slower animations.</p>

<h2>I've created templates for all 15 cursors, but where do they go?</h2>
<p>Windows uses fifteen cursors to map out pointer tasks. Linux could use even more than that.<br />
The mappings that worked for me are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Normal Select is <b>left_ptr</b> or <b>arrow</b></li>
<li>Help Select is <b>gumby</b> or <b>question_arrow</b></li>
<li>Working In Background is <b>left_ptr_watch</b></li>
<li>Busy is <b>watch</b></li>
<li>Handwriting cursor is <b>pencil</b></li>
<li>Beam or Text Select is <b>xterm</b></li>
<li>Cross/Precison Select is <b>cross</b></li>
<li>NWSE/Diagonal Resize 1 is both <b>top_left_corner</b> and <b>bottom_right_corner</b></li>
<li>NESW/Diagonal Resize 2 is both <b>top_right_corner</b> and <b>bottom_left_corner</b></li>
<li>NS/Vertical Resize is <b>v_double_arrow</b>, <b>top_side</b> and <b>bottom_side</b></li>
<li>WE/Horizontal Resize is <b>h_double_arrow</b>, <b>left_side</b> and <b>right_side</b></li>
<li>Move or Resize All is <b></b>, <bgrabbing></b> and <b>size_all</b></li>
<li>No/Unavailable is <b>crosfleursed_circle</b> and <b>no_drop</b></li>
<li>Up/Alternative Select is <b>center_ptr</b></li>
<li>Link Select is <b>link</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>We know where to map them, but where do I put them?</h2>
<p>In Ubuntu, the cursors should be stored in the following location:</p>

```
/usr/share/icons/<ThemeName>/cursors/<put them here>
```

<p>Install the Gnome Tweak Tool to select any cursor located in this folder. Some of the prefabricated
shell scripts in this project will automatically toggle the appropriate settings for you. If you want to
take a chimeric route in theming, you can simply edit the script to point to another existing resource. If
you bungle the script, a fresh copy is waiting for you here to start over.</p>
